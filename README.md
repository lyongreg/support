<h1>Gnip Support</h1>
<h2>Example Code Snippets</h2>
<p>This repository contains sample code snippets that demonstrate the basic API methods available on Gnip's API.  These are broken into two categories:
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Premium Stream Connection</strong> - Establish a streaming connection to a premium Gnip stream, using gzip compression</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Rules API</strong> - Add, Delete, and List rules on premium and Enterprise Data Collector streams</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>The snippets are available in the following programming languages:
	<ul>
		<li>
			C#</li>
		<li>
			Java</li>
		<li>
			PHP</li>
		<li>
			Python</li>
		<li>
			Ruby</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
These is also a Java example for using the Rehydration API, available here: 

<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Other APIs </li>
	</ul>

</p>


<p>These snippets should serve as an example only for the basic API functions, and do not provide additional functionality that will be crucuial to the success of your application (e.g. reconnect logic, batching rule updates, complying with rate limits, validating rules, retrying failed updates, etc.).</p>
